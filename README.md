# VHDL_mini_proj
VHDL project by Mateusz Szalkowski  
In my project I am displaying 2 purple boxes over a background made of black and white boxes.
One of the purple boxes is moving randomly and bouncing off the odeges of the screen. 
Other box can be moved by user using embedded push buttons in directions of up, down, left, right.
